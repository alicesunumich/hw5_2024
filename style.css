11 Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) and the nav_links class to match our example using flex-properties. The logo should be as far to the left as possible and the links as far to the right as possible. Use flex properties, NOT position properties.

12 Edit the css for the pricing and card classes to match our example. Part of achieving this is by using a flex-property to specify a “size” of 275px. Notice that the elements do not have the same height, but do have the same width.

13 Modify the first header (the one not inside main) so that it remains visible at the top of the screen even as we scroll down. Make sure that it is always visible. You can see an example of this in the video and in the screenshot at 1200px when scrolled. This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it. */
